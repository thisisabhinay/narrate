                    Last week, I went out in the woods in Oregon with this bird
                    expert, Noah Strycker, looking at birds. Every day he goes
                    out for at least an hour-- often, it's a lot more-- on
                    trails around his house that he and his parents cleared back
                    when he was a kid. And I'd never been birding. I had no idea
                    how much of bird watching you're actually just listening for
                    the birds. When we'd set out in the morning, it was still
                    foggy.

                    Already, I can hear some birds calling now. So there's a
                    spotted towhee, [IMITATING BIRD CALL], calling just behind
                    me. That [IMITATING BIRD CALL] was a California quail waking
                    up. Did you hear that little [IMITATING BIRD CALL]? [BIRD
                    CALL] That was the sound of a Steller's jay imitating a
                    red-tailed hawk.

                    Yeah, it's not a real red-tailed hawk. Steller's jays are
                    just kind of bullies, in general, and they imitate red
                    tailed hawks, as far as I can tell, just to terrorize other
                    little birds in the forest.
